Overlapping rectangles
Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle. Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping. (L1 and R1 are the extreme points of the first rectangle and L2 and R2 are the extreme points of the second rectangle).
Note: It may be assumed that the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis.

Example 1:

Input:
L1=(0,10)
R1=(10,0)
L2=(5,5)
R2=(15,0)
Output:
1
Explanation:
The rectangles overlap.

Input:
L1=(0,2)
R1=(1,1)
L2=(-2,-3)
R2=(0,2)
Output:
0
Explanation:
The rectangles do not overlap.
