Question 5

Problem:Ugly Numbers

Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, â€¦ shows the first 11 ugly numbers. By convention, 1 is included. Write a program to find Nth Ugly Number.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 10th ugly number is 12.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
